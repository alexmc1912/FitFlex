## Project Description


Our online web application will provide our users with a platform to reach their fitness goals, create healthy eating habits and
ultimately be the best version of themselves. Our aim is to create exercise, diet and lifestyle plans that can functionally change 
how someone operates in their fitness journey. Creating a functional and effective exercise and diet routine can be a difficult and 
tedious task, even for the most experienced. This often discourages beginners, making them question the value of their efforts. Our 
application simplifies this process, focusing on enabling users to make meaningful lifestyle changes as effectively and efficiently 
as possible! 

Our users will have profiles, whereby they can keep an eye on how far they have come in their journey. They will register with
email/username and password and will be able to access the site with Windows or MacOS. They will be able to track their calories,
their previous workouts and of course make new ones to push themselves even further.

In terms of our user interface, we will be going for an efficient and easy to use system. Large displays and intuitive buttons will
be in effect so that even the most novice of technology users will be able to gain the benefits of our services. This is vital as
the main goal of our application is to make exercise and working out as easy as possible and using a confusing and complicated
interface would only do the opposite.

Our application will gather user information to generate personalised and practical plans tailored to individual needs. These plans
will include details such as training types, session durations, specific exercises, suitable foods, and other effective tips to
create a well-structured workout regimen that works for each user.


## Division of Work


In an attempt to make our workload as manageable as possible, we have decided to split our interests into two categories, front end
development and back end development. Kieron will mostly deal with front end, user interface development, while Alex will deal
largely with our back end development. Our work will be conducted with an agile approach in mind. We will make weekly targets and
arrangements, attack problems head on as a team and finally, create weekly sprints that are manageable.


## Programming Languages


For our project we will be using the programming language Python. We have decided to use python in this instance as we both feel we
have a strong background knowledge in the language. Finally, we will also use languages such as HTML and CSS for the customisation 
of our user interface. We will also use Javascript using React.


## Programming Tools


For our project we will use multiple different programming tools in order to bring our project to fruition. We will also be using Bootstrap to develop the front end of our application. We will also use React for the backend of our application.


## Learning Challenges


A project of this magnitude will certainly take up a huge amount of time and energy and require ahuge amount of planning and 
scheduling. We aim to stick to these constraints that we set for ourselves.


## Hardware / Software Platform


Our web application will be available on all computer platforms. Our hardware requirements will be any laptop or desktop computer.
